**Detty December: Economic Impact and Public Safety Implications in Lagos
Project Overview**

Detty December is a major seasonal tourism and entertainment phenomenon in Lagos State, attracting large volumes of domestic and international visitors during the month of December. While the event generates substantial economic activity across hospitality, entertainment, and aviation-related sectors, the concentration of visitors within a short time period places increased pressure on transport infrastructure and emergency response systems.

This project analyzes the economic impact of Detty December alongside seasonal visitor pressure to assess implications for infrastructure strain and public safety. The analysis is designed to support evidence-based policy planning rather than operational forecasting.

**Objectives**

The project aims to:

Estimate the total economic impact of Detty December on Lagos State

Identify the sectors that contribute most to peak-season revenue

Assess how concentrated economic activity during December compares to non-peak periods

Highlight implications for transport safety and emergency response planning

**Business Questions**

What is the total estimated economic impact of Detty December on Lagos State?

Which sectors contribute the most to Detty December revenue?

Hospitality (Hotels vs Short-stay)

Events & Entertainment

Aviation (proxy)

How concentrated is economic activity during December compared to non-peak periods?

Data Sources

This project uses proxy datasets compiled from publicly available reports, tourism statistics, and industry summaries. The data is intended for high-level analytical insight and policy discussion rather than exact financial accounting.

**Data Model**

The analysis applies a star schema design consisting of:

**Fact tables**

fact_economic_impact

fact_visitor_flow

**Dimension tables**

dim_time

dim_sector

Surrogate keys (time_id, sector_id) are used to support consistent aggregation, seasonal analysis, and scalability.

**Tools & Technologies**

SQL Server – data validation and aggregation checks

Power BI – data transformation, modeling, DAX measures, and visualization

Power Query – data cleaning and key derivation

GitHub – project documentation and versioning

**Key Measures**

Total Revenue (NGN)

Total Visitors

Peak vs Off-Peak Visitors

Visitor Surge (Peak – Off-Peak)

Revenue per Visitor

**Key Insights**

Detty December generates significant economic value, concentrated within a short peak period.

Economic gains are driven primarily by hospitality, entertainment, and aviation-linked activity.

The concentration of visitor movement during December places predictable strain on transport infrastructure and emergency response systems.

Seasonal patterns are consistent, making proactive, data-driven planning feasible.

**Policy Implications**

The findings suggest that Lagos State can preserve the economic benefits of Detty December while reducing public safety risks through seasonal scaling of emergency response capacity, traffic management, and inter-agency coordination.

**Disclaimer**

This analysis uses proxy datasets and seasonal estimates to support high-level policy discussion. Findings should be complemented with operational transport, health, and emergency service data for implementation decisions.
